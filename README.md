# Java Minesweeper Game

A simple Minesweeper game implemented in Java.

## Features

* Generates a random board with mines
* Allows the player to make moves and reveal cells
* Checks for win and loss conditions
* Includes unit tests for game logic

## Requirements

* Java 8 or later
* JUnit 5 or later (for unit tests)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the code.
2. Compile the code using `javac`.
3. Run the game using `java Main`.

## Usage

* Run the game and follow the prompts to play.
* Use the numbers 0-9 to enter row and column numbers.
* Use the `q` key to quit the game.

## How It Works

The game uses a simple text-based interface to interact with the player. The game board is represented as a 2D array of cells, where each cell can be either a mine or a safe cell. The game generates a random board with mines and allows the player to make moves to reveal cells. The game checks for win and loss conditions after each move.

## Unit Tests

The game includes unit tests for the game logic, including tests for board generation, move validation, and win and loss conditions. The tests use JUnit 5 and can be run using the `javac` and `java` commands.
